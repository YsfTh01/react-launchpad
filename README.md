3. **Download the Files**  
   Find the download links for files that match your system (Windows, Mac, Linux). Click on the files to start downloading. The files usually end in `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. Save these files on your computer.

4. **Extract the Files**  
   After the download is complete, find the file you just downloaded. Right-click on it and select "Extract All" (or the equivalent option on your computer). This will create a new folder with all the files you need.

   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/folder` with the actual path where you saved the files.

7. **Install the Dependencies**  
   In the terminal or command prompt, type the following command to install the necessary tools:  
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command will download everything your application needs to run.

8. **Run the Application**  
   Once the installation is complete, type the following command to start your application:  
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   After a moment, your web browser should open with your new React application running.
